#### Reading 
Chapter 1 of The Design of Everyday Things 
Introduction and Chapter 1 of Archeologies of Touch 
#### Lab 
Do the first 2 exercises from the lab book pdf I will place on the slack. These are not required but they are encouraged to enable you to do the homework. 

#### Homework 
Get playful with buttons and LEDS. Make a simple timing game such as Simon Says with at least 3 levels and a clear start and end. Have 3 buttons for interaction and make it so you press the first botton to start the game. When the game is over, all 3 LEDS should come on and stay in until the start button is pressed again. If you have an idea for a better game, give it a go. I'm open to you editing these briefs. This is graduate school, have fun. 

** You are going to need to turn this on online on github classroom. Make a .md file for each week. (ie week01.md) More info coming here over the week. This is a work in progress. Worst case if we don't get it up, just bring stuff next week in a folder and I'll review.** 

Always and for all future projects document your project and include a photo or two, a short video of it working from your phone, your code, and a description of the project.
