**Shift Registers and Multiplexing**

This week we took a look at shift registers. They allow you to vastly expand your inputs and outputs for the Arduino platform. 

Please follow this tutorial online and build both examples:

Submit a short video as always. 

Additionally, here's a video that explains how shift registers work:

**Bitmasks, Bitwise Operators and Bit Shifting**  
We looked at how to bit shift and what bit masks are. 

Please read the explanation here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation 

To see how this work in arduino, review the section on Bitwise Operators here:

When will you ever use this? It's really great for sending data over radio or BLE where you have a very limited amount of data. If you want to see an advanced example from one of my current projects in progress, check out the Thrum folder for more. This controls a haptic grid and I am switching the motors on and off via bitmasking. This code is a WORK IN PROGRESS and also mine. Please don't repost it.
