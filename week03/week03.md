Today we're going to use PWM to fade an LED. 

1. Playing with fades 

* Go here and build this circuit. Try typing the code yourself: 
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Fade 

Solder this circuit to perfboard. It should only be 1 resistor and 1 led and to wires you can plug into your arduino. It's an easy first soldering task, basically, replace the breadboard with a soldering iron. 

Take a short video to submit of the working circuit. 

2. Voltage Dividers 
Hook up a potentometer. See last week's circuits if you don't remember how to do so. Using a multimeter, measure the change of voltage as you watch the knob change. This is for you. 

No documentation required  but it's a fun thing to try out.

3. Making a dark detecting LED 
Together, we are going to build this project to better understand transistors

There is one change though, verses use a battery, we're just going to power our circuit with the Arduino 3V out. 

Take a short video to submit of the working circuit.
