Brief with assignment dates coming soon. Know your final projects should be done by the last day of class and your in class assignments should be done by class time each each. 

## Introduction
Physical Computing systems let designers re-think and critique how computational interactions are designed. You can see these creative innovations in museums, galleries, stores, games, robotics, immersive theatre performances, connected apps, dance, AR, MR and beyond. Our world is sonic, tangible, tactile, visually dynamic, olfactory or any combination of these sensations. How can we create computing systems which engage us beyond the screen?  The course will explain and demonstrate how the environment can be seen as data measured by sensors. We will explore the intersection of the interface with the body using systems we create. This study encompasses basic physics, electronics, programming and software engineering. The practical objective of this course is the development of the skills needed for designing and building interactive physical devices.
	
### Indicative Content 
	
* Build physical systems using modern prototyping techniques
* Create PCB circuit boards
* Write original programs for a micro-controller
* Creating a compelling physical enclosure for a physical computing system 
* Using 3D printers and laser cutters  
	
### On completion of this unit you will be able to:
* Design a physical computing specification
* Implement a physical computing system from a design specification 
* Critically evaluate a physical computing system from an engineering or an artistic perspective 
* Critically discuss ethics and values around fabrication technologies

### Assessment Requirements

* Portfolio of work: documenting the outcomes for the set project work. This will also include a research weblog documenting your iterative design and development process specifically in the areas of physical computing. (50% weighting of unit mark) 
* An original creative work An original work of art using physical computing and fabrication techniques (50% weighting of unit mark) 

For more information about how your assignments are marked, please go to section 4.0: assessment. You will receive an assignment brief, which will give you more detail.


### Teaching and Learning Methods
	
To enable you to demonstrate achievement against the learning outcomes, the subject will be introduced through a range of studio-based workshops and assignments supported where appropriate by lectures, seminars, critiques and visits.
