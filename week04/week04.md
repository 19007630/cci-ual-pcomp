# Week 04 - Capacitors, Transistors and Motors 


### Lab 1 - Project proposal 

For next week make sure you fill out [the final project proposal form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=xClkjH8We0e4y3fugnWNEa_IpvLdCKxAiyTVLgfCWbdUNk1FVFA4QTBOTkNUS1c0RFZKMFNNNTY5WS4u)

### Lab 2 - Hook up a servo. 

Hook up a servo and make it move using pwm.
[Do this tutorial](https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Servo-Motors/) 

### Lab 3 = Hook up a motor 
Using the circuit from the Arduino project book, do project 9. Feel free to get creative with the pinwheel bit of you want. 

### Lab 4 - Hook up an MPR121 
Create a circuit you control with a touch sensor.  
[Do this tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mpr121-12-key-capacitive-touch-sensor-breakout-tutorial/overview)
   
### Lab 5 - The Capsense library 
[Give a go with this tutorial](https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/CapacitiveSensor/) 
What are some creative ideas you could do with this? Try one out and submit it as this lab.
